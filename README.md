# Abstract

This paper focuses on two prominent modeling techniques for switch mode DC/DC power converters: between (a) the average model and (b) the switched model. The general case of the regular model uses the constant 
hanging of the voltages or currents to that of the average switched model, which applies them for the fractional part of the commutation period. Here I will look into the switched model technique and its application in integrating power switches 
layout. The simulation model is designed using eSim simulation software, which acts as a 
powerful environment for circuit simulations and analysis. eSim being the link between the 
abstract circuit design and the practical implementation, the designers can shortcut the design 
process. This way, when surprises pop up, they can manage them. Modelling and simulation 
methods will be applied on popular control PWM Integrated Circuits UC 1525 and UC 
1846. Different elements, including the oscillator, error amplifier, and comparator are 
designed and simulated with subcircuits.
